# Model Card for Model ID

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->



## Model Details

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->

This is the model card of a ðŸ¤— transformers model that has been pushed on the Hub. This model card has been automatically generated.

- **Developed by:** SJ Lee, YJ Kim, SH Kim
- **Activity with:** GMLB 2024, Gemma Sprint
- **Language(s) (NLP):** Korean
- **Finetuned from model [optional]:** google/gemma2-2b

### Model Sources

<!-- Provide the basic links for the model. -->

- **References:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1weTpKOjBZxZJ5PQ-Ql8i6ptAY2x-FWVA?usp=sharing
- **References:** https://www.sktenterprise.com/bizInsight/blogDetail/dev/9480

## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

### Direct Use

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->

[More Information Needed]

### Data Resource
https://www.aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&topMenu=100&aihubDataSe=data&dataSetSn=71776
<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->

[More Information Needed]

### Out-of-Scope Use

<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->

[More Information Needed]

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->

[More Information Needed]

### Recommendations

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.

## Training Details
Gemma2 2B + Lora Finetuning
### Training Data
train.csv
<!-- This should link to a Dataset Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->

[More Information Needed]

### Training Procedure

<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->

#### Training Hyperparameters

- **Training regime:** [More Information Needed] <!--fp32, fp16 mixed precision, bf16 mixed precision, bf16 non-mixed precision, fp16 non-mixed precision, fp8 mixed precision -->

#### Speeds, Sizes, Times [optional]

<!-- This section provides information about throughput, start/end time, checkpoint size if relevant, etc. -->

[More Information Needed]

## Evaluation

<!-- This section describes the evaluation protocols and provides the results. -->

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

<!-- This should link to a Dataset Card if possible. -->

[More Information Needed]

#### Factors

<!-- These are the things the evaluation is disaggregating by, e.g., subpopulations or domains. -->

[More Information Needed]

#### Metrics

<!-- These are the evaluation metrics being used, ideally with a description of why. -->

[More Information Needed]

### Results

#### Summary



## Model Examination [optional]

<!-- Relevant interpretability work for the model goes here -->

[More Information Needed]

## Environmental Impact

<!-- Total emissions (in grams of CO2eq) and additional considerations, such as electricity usage, go here. Edit the suggested text below accordingly -->

Carbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).
